# YOLOv8 Object Detection with Relaxing Music

This project uses YOLOv8 for object detection to detect objects through a webcam. If a person is detected, a chatbot prompt will ask if they want to listen to relaxing music. If the user presses 'y', relaxing music will play. The user can exit the program and stop the music by pressing 'Esc'.

## Requirements

- Python 3.7 or higher
- OpenCV
- PyGame
- Ultralytics (YOLOv8)
- A webcam
- Music file (e.g., `music.mp3`)
